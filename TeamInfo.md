## Project Summary

Our web application will allow registered users to store a collection of their favorite video
games. Moreover, users will be able to get recommendations for games they might like. If there
is a game which is not immediately available within the web applicationâ€™s game library, users
will still be able to add those as well. Users will also be able to browse through the collection of
Steam games through the web application. We will be using the class provided dataset of Steam
games
